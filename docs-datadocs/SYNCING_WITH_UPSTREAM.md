# Syncing with Upstream

This is a SOP document for regularly synchronizing with the upstream codebase: <https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm>

Relevant links:

- [DuckDB Release](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases)
- [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

**It is highly recommended to prepare an independent local code of this repo** before starting the instructions in the next section.

Because you might need to compare API changes between current forked version and the latest version and inspect source files without any [Git conflict markers](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line) during Git rebase.

And here are example commands for this preparation:

``` bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/datadocs/duckdb-wasm.git datadocs-duckdb-wasm-snapshot
# Then you can inspect the code in the directory `datadocs-duckdb-snapshot`
```

## Prerequisites

Firstly, make sure you have added the URL of official repository in your git remote. Here is the command for it:

```bash
git remote get-url upstream 2>/dev/null || git remote add upstream https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm.git
```


Then, please update your local git history from the upstream repo:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

## Sync The New Release


We can first define two environment variables `LAST_VER` and `NEW_VER` to simplify the subsequent commands. And if the base commit for the new version doesn't have a same name tag with `NEW_VER`, please define another variable `NEW_VER_GIT_REF`:

```bash
# The version of last sync
LAST_VER="v1.2"

# The new version you want to sync from the upstream repo.
# Any branch name or tag name in upstream repo can be used here: (e.g., "main")
NEW_VER="v1.3"
NEW_VER_GIT_REF="dbe2d00ce519720919e9564443396c5b5c2ad20c";
```

Next, create a new branch to merge our changes into the new version of upstream source code:

```bash
git checkout datadocs-$LAST_VER
git checkout -b datadocs-$NEW_VER

# Tagging the target commit as a marker
git tag -s -m "The base commit of Datadocs forked version ${NEW_VER}" "datadocs-${NEW_VER}-base" "$NEW_VER_GIT_REF";

# It is highly RECOMMENDED to rebase our changes into the target branch/tag by GUI program
# to avoid elementary mistakes.
# For example: Sublime Merge, GitKraken
git rebase --interactive $NEW_VER_GIT_REF
```

> [!TIP]
>
> 1. All changes on `.github` can be removed during Git rebase. This forked repo doesn't use them.
> 2. Here is a brief explanation about Git conflict markers:
>     - **Current Change**: The latest code from the upstream
>     - **Incoming Change**: The changes we made previously
>

Next, after successfully rebasing the all changes into the target branch/tag, please do the following checks :

1. Clean and rebuild DuckDB again: `make clean && ./scripts/build-duckdb-for-datadocs.sh release`
2. Run built DuckDB shell (bin file: `./build/release/duckdb`) perform at least the following tests:
    1. The `VARIANT` type (e.g., `SELECT 1::VARIANT::JSON`, ...)
3. Build DuckDB WASM again with this latest change (pointing `submodules/duckdb` sub-module to the this `datadocs-$NEW_VER` branch) and test that WASM file in the browser


Moreover, please check the differences between our forked version and the upstream version on Github to make sure there are not any unexpected merge result. An example link: <https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm/compare/main...datadocs:duckdb-wasm:datadocs-v1.2>

Finally, you push this new branch to our forked repository:

```bash
# Please change the following `origin` to your custom remote name if you changed it
git push origin datadocs-$NEW_VER

# Push the base marker tag to the Github repo
git push origin --force ingest-${NEW_VER}-base
```
